## Download

Download the latest version for your operating system. All 3 files (exe, dmg, AppImage) contain the binary, translations and required libraries to run RRCC on the target platform without installing anything.

* [Windows (exe)](https://github.com/LazyT/rrcc/releases)

This is an [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) self extracting archive. It will be automatically extracted to "%temp%\7zxxxxxxxx" and after that the "rrcc.exe" is started. You can copy this directory or extract the file with 7z if you want the content.

* [MacOS (dmg)](https://github.com/LazyT/rrcc/releases)

This is an Apple disc image. You can mount and run or copy the application.

* [Linux (AppImage)](https://github.com/LazyT/rrcc/releases)

This is an [AppImage](https://appimage.org) package. Don't forget to "chmod +x *.AppImage" after download and then run it. You can use the parameter "--appimage-extract" if you want the content.
